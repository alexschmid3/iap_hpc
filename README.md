# Assignment 8

### Submitting a job array

In the folder `5_assignment`, we have a script, `buildandsolve.jl`, that creates a network using input parameters `randomseed` and `numnodes`, then solves a shortest path from ``node=1` to `node=numnodes` just as we saw in class. 

The parameters of five networks are given in the file `experiments.csv`.
