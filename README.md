# Assignment 8

### Submitting a job array

In the folder `5_assignment`, we have a script, `buildandsolve.jl`, that creates a network using input parameters `randomseed` and `numnodes`, then solves a shortest path from ``node=1` to `node=numnodes` just as we saw in class. 

The parameters of five networks are given in the file `experiments.csv`. 
1. Write a batch script that kicks off an array of 5 jobs, watching taking in a parameter 1-5 and passing it to the script `buildandsolve.jl`.
2. Submit your batch script to the cluster, being sure to resolve any errors. If youâ€™re having issues, add a output log and error log file to your batch script.
3. Take a screenshot of the contents of your outputs folder after the job completes and the email you received upon completion.
